Image Generation for E-commerce

This is the Consulting & Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati's capstone project for the Summer Analytics 2024 course. 

Project Overview: Develop a generative artificial intelligence model to generate superior product photos for online retailers.

Use Cases: 

*Problem Statement: * Product Image Augmentation: * Low-quality and diversified product photos on e-commerce platforms have a negative effect on client confidence and sales. 

*Solution: To improve product listings, generate several high-resolution photos from diverse angles and settings using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment existing product images. 

Virtual Try-On Experiences: * Issue Statement: Due to concerns regarding appearance and fit, customers are reluctant to make online purchases of clothing and accessories. 

*Solution: Use generative AI to create a virtual try-on feature that lets buyers see items as they would appear on themselves.
